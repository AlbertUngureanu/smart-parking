# smart-parking

Developed an application in C++ using some Arduino UNO boards, ultrasonic sensors and bluetooth modules.
This app was created to overcome the problem of wasting time while looking for a parking space in a crowded place.
When someone wants to enter the parking, it verifies if there are any available parking slots and assigns the customer the closest one to the gate.
